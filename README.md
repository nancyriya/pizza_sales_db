Problem Statement
In a competitive food and beverage industry, understanding customer preferences and optimizing sales performance is critical for business growth. The pizza chain in this case study has been collecting sales data over time but lacks a clear, visual representation of key business metrics. Without an analytical dashboard, decision-makers struggle to:

Identify high-performing and low-performing pizza types

Track daily, weekly, and monthly sales trends

Understand peak sales hours and customer purchasing behavior

Optimize inventory and staffing based on demand patterns

Steps followed
Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a csv file.

Used a sample dataset (pizza_sales.csv) containing:

Order IDs, Dates, Pizza Names

Pizza Categories and Sizes

Quantity Sold, Price per Unit, and Total Sales

total_price = quantity √ó price

order_month, order_day, order_hour for trend analysis.

Pizza type and category

Time (hourly, daily, monthly)

Size and quantity
